# orca-term

Orchestrate a fleet of parallel CLI coding agents from the terminal, with Neovim as the editor.

Inspired by [Orca](https://github.com/stablyai/orca), but without the Electron app: each agent
runs in its own git worktree, and review happens in the tools already living in the terminal.

## Status

Early. The route was charted as a [wayfinder](https://aihero.dev/skills-wayfinder) map in this
repo's issues (the issue labelled `wayfinder:map`) and synthesised into a spec. It is now being
built in small slices, each a GitHub issue under that spec.

Today: `orca-term worktree ls [--json]` lists the worktrees of the current repository.

## Development

Needs Rust 1.97 and [just](https://github.com/casey/just). `just check` runs every check CI runs;
see `docs/harness.md` for the tools it expects and the rules it enforces. `just hooks` installs the
local git hooks (needs [lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook)).

### Tools for the Neovim client

`just lua`, part of `just check`, formats, lints and type-checks the Lua and runs its specs in
headless Neovim. It needs Neovim 0.11 or later, [StyLua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua),
[selene](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene),
[lua-language-server](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server) and
[LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org) with LuaJIT. Set them up once; on macOS with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install neovim luajit stylua selene lua-language-server luarocks
just lua-rocks   # installs busted and nlua, pinned, into .rocks/ (ignored by git)
```

On Linux, CI shows the way: the tools come from their GitHub releases at the versions pinned in
`.github/workflows/check.yml`, LuaRocks and the Lua 5.1 headers from the distribution
(`luarocks liblua5.1-0-dev` on Ubuntu), then `just lua-rocks`.

## Scope

In: parallel agents in isolated worktrees, diff review that can feed comments back to the agent
that wrote the code, Neovim integration over a standalone core.

Out: mobile companion, cloud relay, screenshot-driven design mode, Linear integration,
worktrees over SSH.
