# orca-term

Orchestrate a fleet of parallel CLI coding agents from the terminal, with Neovim as the editor.

Inspired by [Orca](https://github.com/stablyai/orca), but without the Electron app: each agent
runs in its own git worktree, and review happens in the tools already living in the terminal.

## Status

Early. The route was charted as a [wayfinder](https://aihero.dev/skills-wayfinder) map in this
repo's issues (the issue labelled `wayfinder:map`) and synthesised into a spec. It is now being
built in small slices, each a GitHub issue under that spec.

Today: `orca-term lane ls [--json]` lists the lanes of the current repository.

## Development

Needs Rust 1.97 and [just](https://github.com/casey/just). `just check` runs every check CI runs;
see `docs/harness.md` for the tools it expects and the rules it enforces. `just hooks` installs the
local git hooks (needs [lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook)).

## Scope

In: parallel agents in isolated worktrees, diff review that can feed comments back to the agent
that wrote the code, Neovim integration over a standalone core.

Out: mobile companion, cloud relay, screenshot-driven design mode, Linear integration,
worktrees over SSH.
